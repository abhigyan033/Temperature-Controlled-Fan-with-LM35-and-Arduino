## Project Overview
The goal is to create a fan that automatically adjusts its speed based on the ambient temperature. A higher temperature will make the fan spin faster, and a lower temperature will make it spin slower or turn off completely.

## Components:
* Arduino Uno
* LM35 Temperature Sensor (or its more modern equivalent, the TMP36)
* DC Motor
* TIP120 transistor
* IN4007 Diode
* Resistor 1K Ohm
* Breadboard and Jumper cables
* External Power Supply

**Why the external components?**

Transistor: Acts as a switch/amplifier, allowing a small current from the Arduino to control a large current for the motor.
Diode: Protects the transistor from a reverse voltage spike generated by the motor's coil when it suddenly turns off.
Resistor: Limits the current flowing into the transistor's base from the Arduino pin.

## Working
How LM35 Works Internally:
* The LM35 uses the fundamental property that the forward voltage of a silicon diode decreases predictably with temperature (-2.2mV/°C)
* Internal circuitry amplifies and linearizes this effect to produce a clean 10mV/°C output
* No external calibration needed because it's based on physical semiconductor properties.
* The LM35 output is directly proportional to Celsius temperature, unlike thermistors which require complex conversion formulas.

Arduino ADC Process:
* Arduino's internal capacitor charges to the LM35 output voltage.
* Internal comparator checks against reference voltages.
* 10-bit result (0-1023) representing voltage level.

Control Logic:
* Below 25°C: Complete shutdown saves power and reduces noise
* 25-50°C: Linear response provides smooth, proportional control
* Above 50°C: Maximum cooling when needed most
* Minimum PWM = 50: Overcomes motor stiction and ensures reliable startup.

Why We Need a Transistor:

Problem: Arduino GPIO pins can only supply ~20mA at 5V (0.1W)
Typical DC Fan Requirements: 100-500mA at 5-12V (0.5-6W)
Solution: Use transistor as a current amplifier.

Transistor Operating Regions:
* Cutoff Region (PWM = 0): No base current → transistor OFF → motor OFF
* Active Region (PWM 1-254): Proportional control → variable motor speed
* Saturation Region (PWM = 255): Maximum base current → transistor fully ON

Current Calculation:
I_base = (5V - V_BE) / R = (5V - 1.4V) / 1000Ω ≈ 3.6mA

Motor Speed Control:

PWM = Rapidly switching power ON/OFF to control average voltage
Duty Cycle = (ON Time / Total Period) × 100%
Examples:
PWM = 0   → 0% duty cycle → 0V average → Motor OFF
PWM = 127 → 50% duty cycle → 2.5V average → Medium speed  
PWM = 255 → 100% duty cycle → 5V average → Full speed

Protection Circuit:

The Back EMF Problem:
When motor current is suddenly interrupted, the magnetic field in the motor coils collapses, generating a large voltage spike in the opposite direction.

Diode Protection Mechanism:

Normal Operation: Diode reverse-biased (OFF) - no effect

During Shutdown: Back EMF forward-biases diode, creating safe current path
